No man is an island,
Entire of itself.
Each is a piece of the continent,
A part of the main.
If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less.
As well as if a promontory were.
As well as if a manor of thine own
Or of thine friend's were.
Each man's death diminishes me,
For I am involved in mankind.
Therefore, send not to know
For whom the bell tolls,
It tolls for thee.

John Donne

Can you translate this poem to standard english, please

No man is an island,
Entire of itself.
Each is a piece of the continent,
A part of the main.
If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less.
As well as if a promontory were.
As well as if a manor of thine own
Or of thine friend's were.
Each man's death diminishes me,
For I am involved in mankind.
Therefore, send not to know
For whom the bell tolls,
It tolls for thee.

John Donne

Certainly! Here's the translation of the poem:

No one is entirely self-sufficient,
We all depend on each other.
We are all parts of a larger community,
And when one person is lost, we all suffer.

Even if just a small patch of land is lost to the sea,
The entire continent is affected.
It is as if a whole headland disappeared,
Or a grand estate, either your own or a friend's.

The death of any person diminishes us all,
For we are all interconnected as human beings.
So, do not ask for whom the bell tolls,
It tolls for thee, and for all of us.

What does it mean "whom the bell tolls"

The phrase "For whom the bell tolls" comes from the poem "Meditation XVII" by John Donne. In the poem, Donne explores the idea that no person is an island and that we are all connected to each other as part of a larger whole.

The phrase itself refers to the sound of a funeral bell tolling, which traditionally signaled the passing of someone in the local community. In the context of the poem, it suggests that the death of any person affects us all, because we are all part of the same community.

So, when Donne writes "Do not ask for whom the bell tolls," he means that we should not worry about whose death the bell is tolling for, because it is tolling for all of us, as we are all connected and affected by the loss of any member of our community.
